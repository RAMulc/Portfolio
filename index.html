                        My dad used to sing little ditties. This was my favorite:
                        There was a young lady named Mabel. She danced on the dining room table.
                        Her face grew red, When the gentleman said ...
                        “Look at the legs on that table!”

                        Today, my son asked "Can I have a book mark?" and I burst into tears.

                        My wife is really mad at the fact that I have no sense of direction. So I packed up my stuff and
                        right.

                        I bought some shoes from a drug dealer. I don't know what he laced them with, but I was tripping
                        all day!

                        Did you know the first French fries weren't actually cooked in France? They were cooked in
